# Tutte power series and Tutte evaluations on moduli space

In this paper we observe that the Tutte polynomial of a (connected) graph
extends nicely to a power series for a metric graph, under a simple
change of variables. For certain values of (x,y), the evaluation
of the Tutte power series at (x,y) defines a continuous function
from the moduli space of metric graphs to the reals,
which extends to the moduli space of tropical curves.
